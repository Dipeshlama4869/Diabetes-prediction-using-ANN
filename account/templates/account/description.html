                Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas,
                 helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. 
                Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. 
                Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

        <h2>Different types of Diabetes</h2>
        <h1>Type 1</h1>
        <P> If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. 
            Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. 
            People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.

    <section class="left-sec">
        <h1>Type 2</h1>
        <P> If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.
